# `breki-styleguides`

We spend more time reading our code than we do writing it.

A lot of people I talk to don't understand the point of that sentence, so I usually fall back on the following
explanation. On average, you're supposed to sleep for about seven to eight hours a night in your bed. But it probably
only took you two or three hours to put it together. Knowing that, wouldn't it make sense to spend some extra time in
the "putting it together" department to ensure that you have the best possible experience in the hundreds of hours
you're expected to sleep there?

My goal with this repo was originally just a place to store my various rulesets for various linters and formatters.
Over time, it grew into something more than that. It is now growing into a fully featured eslint ruleset runner which
I can just `require()` into my other projects and have them taken care of for me.
