# `eslint-config-breki`

We spend more time reading our code than we do writing it.

A lot of people I talk to don't understand the point of that sentence, so I usually fall back on the following
explanation. On average, you're supposed to sleep for about seven to eight hours a night in your bed, right? But it
probably only took you less than one night's worth of sleep to build the bed - far less if it was from IKEA, of course.
You wouldn't build a bed in ten minutes and think it was good enough to be the place where you would be sleeping every
night from then on in. So - knowing that, wouldn't it make sense to spend some extra time in the "putting it together"
department to ensure that you have the best possible experience in the hundreds of hours you're expected to sleep there?

My goal with this repo was originally just a place to store my various rulesets for various linters and formatters.
Over time, it grew into something more than that. It is now growing into a fully featured eslint ruleset runner which
I can just `npm install --save-dev` into my other projects and have them taken care of for me.

## Obligatory `todo` section

- [ ] Still getting an error message by eslint when extending this...
- [ ] Get rid of `validate-commit-msg`.
- [ ] ... or actually find a use for it.
